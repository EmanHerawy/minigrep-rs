write a poem 
about the moon
and the stars
and the sun
and the sky
and the clouds
and the birds
and the trees
and the flowers
and the grass
and the rain

Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now …
